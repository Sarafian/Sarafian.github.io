I recently did a fresh installation of Windows 10. All was great up until the point that I noticed that the connected screens would not power off.

Initially I thought that [Windows Insider Program][1] was at fault because I noticed the issue just after enabling it and after activating the [Windows Subsystem for Linux 2][2] and the [Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend][3]. I was hesitant to believe that they were the issue but I had looked everywhere in the operating system and in fact at the time I thought that this was the only difference with the OS configuration before my fresh installation. 

I've looked in processes, registry key and I even [configured the lockscreen display timeout on Windows][4] to be different from the timeout of turning off the screen. On a sidenote, this is quite a useful feature and I don't understand why it is hidden from the majority. Some people asked to check on drivers as they are some cases when a program or a driver intervenes and doesn't allow the screen to turn off.

But nothing worked and I was ready to give up but I decided to take another look into anything that comes up if would search with `lock`. I lowered my timeouts to 1 and 2 minutes respectevely for locking and turning off and I started some experiments. When I changed the **Background** option, the screens finally powered off. It turns out that when configuring Windows to show a slideshow in the lock screen then the system will keep the screens always powered which in my opinion is wrong. Depending on whether I've configured the [configured the lockscreen display timeout on Windows][4] then 

- when **not**, then I expect the screens to turn off as part of the power management. In this case, the **Background** option in the lock screen settings is irrelevant because in theory the screen should power off and the lock screen wouldn't be visible.
- when **yes**, then I probably want my console to lock much faster than I want my screens to turn off. In this case, I like very much the slideshow option but if I am not active for a long period then I want the screens to turn off.
