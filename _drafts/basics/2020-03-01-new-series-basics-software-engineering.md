During the last years, I've found myself in a situation where I had to explain some software engineering-related topics to people who don't share my technical background. Other times, it happened that the explanation was towards a person with a technical background but the concept would be completely new to them. Explaining a difficult topic to a person without the necessary relevance is not easy but this should not be a blocker. I'm a firm believer that everybody who engages in a certain domain should possess a minimum understanding of it. Also, people around our life should be able to understand what we, the software engineers, do professionally. Everybody understands at the fundamental level how to build a bridge but this doesn't seem to be the case with software engineering.

For the above reasons, I've decided to create this series of blog posts and I hope that I will provide the necessary information to help others understand some of the "hot topics". I already have some topics in mind and if you find the explanations useful please feel free to leave a comment and make a request. 

Before finishing this introduction, I would like to start with some disclaimers to help offer context. Explaining complex and difficult topics to non-experts is not easy. To succeed, certain liberties are required to keep the message simple. I also like using real-life established paradigms as examples because most people relate to something they know and have experienced easier. I'm also not an expert on some of the topics that I'll discuss, so I could be just lying unintentionally. For these reasons, this series will **not be about accuracy** and often there might be some lying on my part. Still, the goal is to provide a good and simple enough explanation of each topic and I hope you find it useful. With this understanding in mind, I will appreciate all comments and suggestions.
