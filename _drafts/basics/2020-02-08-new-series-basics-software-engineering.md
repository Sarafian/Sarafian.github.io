For a while now I've found myself in the situation where I had to explain some software engineering related topics to people who don't share my technical background but it would still be great if they could understand the basics. Some other times, it happened that the explanation was towards a person with a technical background but the concept would be completely foreign to them. Explaining a difficult topic to a person without the necessary relevance is not easy but this should not be a blocker. I'm a firm believer that everybody who engages a certain domain should possess minimum understand of it. Also, people around our life should be to understand what we, the software engineers, do professionally. Everybody understands at the fundamental level how to build a bridge but in the software engineering domain that is often not the case and that creates many problems.

For the above reasons, I've decided to create this series of blog post that I hope will provide the necessary information to help others understand some of the "hot topics". I will not start from zero and at this moment in time I do have in mind some topics that I plan to analyze but if you find the explanations useful please feel free to leave a comment and make a request.

Before finishing of this introduction, I would like to start with some disclaimers to help offer context. Explaining difficult topics to non experts is not easy. In order succeed, certain liberties are required to keep the message simple. I also like using real life established paradigms as examples because most people relate to something they know and have experienced easier. I'm also not expert on some of the topics that I'll discuss, so I could be just lying unintenionally. It is just that I think I have enough technical background and experience that helps me grasp a complex topic and try to explain it. For these reasons, this series will **not be about accuracy** and often there might be some lying on my part. Still, the goal is to provide a good enough simplified explanation of each topic and I hope you find it useful. With this context in mind, I will appreciate all comments and suggestions.
