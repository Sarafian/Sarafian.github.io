This post is part of a series intended to explain software engineering topics to an audience that is not technical or experts. Please consider the original [introduction post]({% link _posts/basics/2020-02-08-new-series-basics-software-engineering.md %}) for more context.

If you search on google with the following `Wikipedia what is software engineering` you will probably end up reading [Wikipedia's page](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering). Usually, first introductory paragraphs from Wikipedia pages are quite good and often quoted in presentations

> Software engineering is a field of engineering, for designing and writing programs for computers or other electronic devices. A software engineer, or programmer, writes software (or changes existing software) and compiles software using methods that improve it. Better quality software is easier to use. Better documentation helps other people understand and maintain it and adds new features. Becoming a software engineer requires experience and practice in writing code. Software engineering may be very difficult work. [1] It may be repeated during the software release life cycle.

Granted that one shouldn't read a couple of lines to understand a topic if I would use this explanation to explain to my parents my profession they wouldn't understand. They would understand the words but they would not understand how much of "software engineering" is around them. 20 years ago, like around the 2000s, most people didn't understand how much of their life already dependent on software engineering this is where I try to provide a more intuitive explanation.

Before the digital age, everything was mechanical and analog. Sure, there were analog implementations where they mimicked a sort of a computer but it was mostly levers, wires and other mechanical and electrical objects, that are outside of my domain to mention, that made something happen. With the advance of computers, all devices however small or large got new components in their designs. Those were boards and electronic chips. The chips were nothing more than a miniaturized version of a big analog implementation that had many advantages. As technology progresses, and chips were adopted more and more, a high level of abstraction was introduced. Up until that moment, the chips were mostly a specific implementation for a specific problem. Feed it with the right sensors and it would always do the same thing. So, for every type of device, you needed a dedicated design. After WW2, manufacturing has evolved into offering more standardized products where the consumer purchases options and features. Often the features are inside the device but are block/disabled and otherwise unavailable to the user of the device. The same, principles start applying to the electronics inside these devices. With the chips becoming more and more complicated.
